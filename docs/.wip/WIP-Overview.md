## Overview

The docs are currently under heavy construction. For starters, the following pages are going to be moved to the site:

- [RetroAchievements Manifesto](/guidelines/users/retroachievements-manifesto.html)
- [Users Code of Conduct](Users-Code-of-Conduct)
- [Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules](/guidelines/users/global-leaderboard-and-achievement-hunting-rules.html)
- [Developer's Code of Conduct](/guidelines/developers/code-of-conduct)
- [Set Plagiarism](Set-Plagiarism)
- [Achievement Scoring](/developer-docs/achievement-scoring)
- [Achievement Set Revisions](/guidelines/content/achievement-set-revisions)
- [Achievements for ROM hacks](/guidelines/content/achievements-for-rom-hacks)
- [Subsets](/guidelines/content/subsets)
- [Working with the Right ROM](/guidelines/content/working-with-the-right-rom)
- [FAQ](/general/faq)

The plan is to have any documentation involving guidelines/policy as well as a general FAQ be in plain sight on [retroachievements.org](https://retroachievements.org). Some of the pages will be merged and will result in the following categories:

- User Code of Conduct
- Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules
- Developer Code of Conduct
- Content Guidelines
- General FAQ

This will eventually allow for the wiki to be more open and dedicated to support docs, tutorials, resources, etc.
