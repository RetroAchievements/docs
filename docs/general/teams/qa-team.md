## Who Is On the QA Team?

The QA team is comprised of experienced developers who have demonstrated a commitment to producing high quality achievement sets and repairing and improving other existing achievement sets.

Current team members can be found on the [About Us](/general/about-us#quality-assurance-team) page.

## QA's Responsibilties and Authorities

QA's primary responsibilities include the following tasks:

- Conduct hash management and administering [Player Compatibility Tests](/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing)
- Ensure set stability across the RetroAchievements library
  - Repair or demote unstable or exploitable sets
  - Resolve or close inactive developer tickets
  - Ensure maintenance of leaderboards
  - Ensure maintenance of Rich Presence
- Flag [noncompliant writing](guidelines/writing-policy) for the writing team to address
- Ensure accurate type markings
- Address other miscellaneous quality issues
- Maintain RetroAchievements content guidelines

QA has the inherent authority to rectify quality related issues in RetroAchievements sets. For any quality issue pertaining to content with an active developer, QA shall first contact the active developer to notify them of the issue and establish a resolution timeframe with one exception - QA may demote content that suffers from significant instability or exploitability prior to establishing two-way communication with an active developer.

QA may add any sets to applicable Meta|QA hubs.
