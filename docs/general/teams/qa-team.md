## Who Is On the QA Team?

The QA team is comprised of experienced developers who have demonstrated a commitment to producing high quality achievement sets and repairing and improving other existing achievement sets.

Current team members can be found on the [About Us](/general/about-us.html#quality-assurance-team) page.

## QA's Responsibilties and Authorities

QA's responsibilities include maintaining inactive developer sets, ensuring all sets conform to the writing policy, add necessary achievement protections, repairing malfunctioning leaderboards, managing unstable sets, overseeing several sub-teams, onboarding people into the [Junior Developer Program](/developer-docs/jr-dev-rules.html), managing hashes, and maintaining content guidelines.

QA has the authority to fix any issues in sets with no active developers.  QA may also fix issues in sets with active developers under the following processes:

No advance coordination required:
- Set-wide exploitation. QA must immediately contact the developer to hand off repair and repromotion responsibility
- Remove custom player input from rich presence to follow [the current policy](/developer-docs/rich-presence.html#rich-presence-custom-name-restriction)

Developer must be contacted, QA may remediate if no response is received within 7 days for:
- Demote set due to instability (generally 10 or more tickets)
- Fix achievement title or description grammar, spelling, capitalization, or wording error
- Demote achievement due to lack of protection or exploit
- Adjust set progression types
- Fix leaderboard or rich presence grammar, spelling, capitalization, or wording error
- Repair leaderboard or rich presence malfunction
