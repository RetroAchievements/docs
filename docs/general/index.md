Welcome to the RetroAchievements documentation!

The docs are currently under heavy construction so be sure to check back often! Each section appears in the sidebar, but here is a brief explanation of the categories:

- **Guidelines**: Details community, user/player, developer, and content policies.
- **General**: FAQ, getting started, support/troubleshooting, and other info that can be useful to all members of the community.
- **Achievement Development**: Extensive information on both the conceptual and technical aspects of making achievements.

We encourage all community members to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dq2E4hE); we use this for most communication.
