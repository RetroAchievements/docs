### RAQUASI88

RAQUASI88 is based on [QUASI88kai](https://github.com/rzumer/quasi88), which is a fork of [QUASI88](https://www.eonet.ne.jp/~showtime/quasi88/) with various improvements.

Documentation is available in the release archives, or in the [repository](https://github.com/rzumer/quasi88/tree/develop/document) for the project. Files that do not end with `.EN.TXT` are in Japanese only.
