# Multi-Disc Games

## m3u files

Changing discs on Playstation requires creating a playlist file (.m3u) for your discs. This may sound intimidating but it's actually very simple.

**Step 1:** Place your .bin and .cue files in the desired location.

**Step 2:** Open Notepad

**Step 3:** Type the names of your .cue files _exactly_ as they're named on your files. When you're finished your text document should look something like this:

When you're finished save the text document in the same location as your game discs with whatever name you like.

**Step 4:** Rename the document, changing the extension from .txt to .m3u

**NOTE:** If you can't see the .txt extension at the end of your text document title you need to change your settings to show known file extensions. In Windows 10 it's very simple, you can find that on your folder under 'View' and a checkbox reading 'File name extensions'

Now you're done! Simple, huh? From here on out, when you start the game, load it using the .m3u file you've just created.

**NOTE:** If you have already played the first disc of a game and find your saves no longer there, you can retrieve them by navigating to your emulators 'saves' folder, finding the save for your first disc and renaming it to match the .m3u you've created. for example:

'Metal Gear Solid (v1.1) (Disc 1).mcr' > 'Metal Gear Solid (v1.1).mcr'
