# What are Subsets?

Subsets are typically extra sets for a game when those achievements would not fit into the main set. There are many types of subsets, but for more info on that topic see [this article](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/subsets.html#types-of-subsets). Subsets typically require an extra patch or sometimes just an alternate revision/version of the game.

## How to Play Subsets

In case that the subset you want to play requires a patch, follow these steps below. Similar steps can be followed when patching a ROM to play a hack.

**Step 1:** Download the patch for the subset of your choice. We'll use [this subset](https://retroachievements.org/game/7596) as an example (in this case, Super Mario Land [Subset - Bonus]).

**Step 2:** Go to [this site](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

**Step 3:** Choose your ROM in the upper field and your patch file in the lower one. Make sure that you are using the correct ROM for the patch (see the readme file that usually comes included with the patch itself). Checking the CRC32, MD5 and SHA-1 hashes between both fields also helps (in this case, the subset offers patches for both the original, unmodified Super Mario Land and the Super Mario Land DX hack. In this tutorial, we'll use the one for the unmodified game). Rom Patcher JS will also tell you the required CRC32 hash for the patch to work.

**Step 4:** Click/tap on "Apply patch" and download your patched ROM (to distinguish it from the original ROM, we recommend naming it like the subset or using "Use patch name for output").

**Step 5:** Open your emulator of choice, then load your patched ROM, and see if a pop-up appears telling you that you're using "X Game [Subset - X]". If so, congratulations! You have properly patched your ROM! Otherwise, repeat all the previous steps.
