# Contributing to the Docs

**All contributions to the docs are welcome.**

We appreciate your interest in contributing. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned developer, we've got you covered. Here's how you can help improve our docs:

## Quick Edits

If you just want to make a quick edit to an existing page, follow these simple steps:

1. **Edit This Page**: Visit any page on the docs site, scroll to the bottom, and click the "Edit this page" link.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork this repository" button. This will create your own copy of the docs.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Use the Markdown editor on the screen to make and preview your changes.
4. **Submit Changes**: Click the "Commit changes" button. Write a title and description for your changes, then submit.
5. **Create Pull Request**: Click the "Create pull request" button. Write a title and description for your pull request and submit it for review.

## Detailed Contributions

If you want to create new pages or work on multiple pages, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Go to the [repository's page](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs) and click the "Fork" button. ![fork button](/public/fork-button.png)
- Press "Create fork" on the form that appears.

### 2. Open in VSCode

- Once you're viewing your fork (usually at `github.com/your-username-here/docs`), press the period (".") key on your keyboard to open VSCode in your browser.
- Use the file tree on the left to explore the docs, specifically by expanding the "docs" folder.
- Use the Ctrl+P hotkey to search for files, such as "README".

### 3. Edit and Preview

- Open the command palette with Ctrl+Shift+P (or F1 in Firefox), search for "markdown preview", and select "Markdown: Open Preview to the Side".
- Use the Markdown preview to see your changes as you write them.

- Click "Create branch", name your branch, press Enter, and then click "Switch to Branch".

## Adding New Pages

If you want to add a new page, you'll need to update the `sidebar` config in [en.ts file](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/blob/main/docs/.vitepress/config/en.ts). This is how you can hook up navigation to new pages.

For example, if your new Markdown file is _docs/general/my-file.md_, add this to `sidebarGeneral()`:

```js
{
    text: "My New Page",
    link: "/general/my-file",
}
```

It is also a best practice to add this to the configs of the other languages to keep them in sync, even if it's commented out:

```js
// {
//     text: "My New Page",
//     link: "/general/my-file",
// }
```

## Running the Docs Site Locally

To run the docs site on your computer:

1. [Download and install Node.js v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).

2. Install Git. [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you're a Windows user.

3. Open a command prompt/terminal and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs.git
```

4. Navigate into the cloned repository and run the local dev server:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your local server should now be running, allowing you to preview your changes.

## Markdown caveats

Markdown is a lightweight and extremely easy to learn markup language with plain text formatting syntax. In order to contribute in our project you must know at least the basics of markdown. Here is a good one-page reference: [http://commonmark.org/help/](http://commonmark.org/help/), and [here you can try a 10 minutes tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

### Headings

The headings (defined by `#`) should follow a natural progression of the hierarchy of the page contents.

```
âœ… GOOD

# Title
## Main heading one
### Sub Heading one
### Sub heading two
## Main heading two
```

Every page _must_ start with a title heading (`#`).

```
ðŸ›‘ BAD

## Main heading one
### Sub Heading one
### Sub heading two
## Main heading two
```

You _cannot_ have two title headings (`#`).

```
ðŸ›‘ VERY BAD

# Title
# Title Two
## Main heading one
### Sub Heading one
### Sub heading two
## Main heading two
```

### Links

Internal docs links should follow this syntax:

```
âœ… GOOD

[Tips and Tricks](/developer-docs/tips-and-tricks.html)
```

Do **NOT** use absolute paths when referencing another page on the docs. VitePress will automatically detect and warn when links are broken, but this detection doesn't kick in for absolute paths.

```
ðŸ›‘ BAD

[Tips and Tricks](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/tips-and-tricks.html)
```

### Images

You can add images to the project by placing them in the _docs/public_ directory.

Links to images should follow this syntax:

```
âœ… GOOD

![current branch](/public/current-branch.png)
```

Try not to reference images on any external site, including RetroAchievements itself. It is dangerous to reference images that are not within _docs/public_ as they might break at any time.

```
ðŸ›‘ BAD

![Image](https://retroachievements.org/Badges/12345.png)
```

Always be sure your alt text within square brackets is accessible. If the image ever breaks for any reason, this text is what users will see. It should be a concise description of the image. Google punishes pages that do not have this text and sometimes delists them altogether so people can't find them. This is very important.

```
ðŸ›‘ VERY BAD

### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

```
First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

It should render like this:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

You can specify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines:

```
First Header | Second Header | Third Header
:----------- |:-------------:| -----------:
Left         | Center        | Right
Left         | Center        | Right
Left         | Center        | Right
```

Results:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| :----------- | :-----------: | -----------: |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |

## VitePress Components
