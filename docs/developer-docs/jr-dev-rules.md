  - Read through all [RetroAchievements Developer Docs](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/) and fill out and post a [Set Design Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VC2phJ9AUcZK5Ll4bVuMpJXED8QdM_nw8OdSAuLc3bI/edit#gid=0)

### Rules and Restrictions

The following rules apply to all Junior Developers:

  - This means no working on any sets that are not claimed.  Failure to adhere to this rule may result in dismissal from the Junior Developer Program
- May not make a new claim while they have any open tickets
- Will prioritize resolving open tickets over development of a new set. If a ticket is in Request status while waiting for information from the reporter, they may continue work on a new set, but must immediately reprioritize the ticket(s) once the reporter responds
- Are not eligible to participate in collaborations
- Are not eligible to revise sets other than ones they've solely authored
  - Must make a revision request in #jr-dev-forum detailing the revision plan. The Code Reviewer team will consider the request for approval

  - Must make a development request in #jr-dev-forum after at least 1 set has been published
- May not make a subset without Code Reviewer approval
  - Must make subset request in #jr-dev-forum. If approved, subset is subject to [Subset Rules](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/subsets.html)
    - May request to create a subset in addition to a primary claim if both are for the same game
- May make a maximum of 2 sets for hacks during the program

### Code Review Requests

Junior Developers are required to ensure sets they submit for Code Review are of the highest quality they can make them. If a set has known issues, Junior Developers must resolve them prior to requesting a Code Reviewer.  Code Reviewers are available to answer questions and offer guidance to assist Junior Developers resolve issues.  The following rules apply to all Junior Developers intending to submit a Code Review request:
- May not submit sets that fail to conform to the [Writing Policy](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/writing-policy.html) or [Code Note Standards](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/code-notes.html)

- Will describe in the Code Review request the self testing method used in order to validate set stability

**Sets that fail to meet Code Review request requirements will be refused entry into the Code Review backlog until remedied**

- 1 month of inactivity with either active development or RA in general
