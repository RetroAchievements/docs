## Quarterly Goals

While the main goal is to promote a bunch of a sets, there are secondary goals that we can work on as a group. If a goal is met, bonus points will be applied _to those who helped reach it_. Goals that are focused on getting the number of sets to a certain number will grant bonus points to everyone who does a set, even after that goal is met. See the Sega Saturn goals [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQj7NMC0nI5DVx9f4emGC3K5zY-8NjKuFPeuAgQ4g0u_8Rbx5oEqByn3zAK-T5XGN9H_g0eziQwuebA/pubhtml?gid=1785919847&single=true).
