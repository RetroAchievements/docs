## Quarterly Goals (WIP)

While the main goal is to promote a bunch of a sets, there are secondary goals that we can work on as a group. If a goal is met, bonus points will be applied _to those who helped reach it_. Goals that are focused on getting the number of sets to a certain number will grant bonus points to everyone who does a set, even after that goal is met. See the Apple II goals [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTN6uDiwB8vTF5470_I5C-A-pStdtktxL3sbMdmoL7U3rYvR8KdR4m85PkLtawWgYxr3EtpWQYlZEa2/pubhtml?gid=1785919847&single=true).
