# Set Development Roadmap

The following is a detailed road-map of most things you would want to consider while making an achievement set. It's not required to follow this exactly but is meant as a guide.

## Initial Research

- **Game manual**: Review
- **Game Faqs**: Read/check
- **Game Cheats**: Find, note
- **Longplay**: Review/watch
- **Similar sets**: Compare, note favorite ideas
- **Partimes**: check if they exist
- **Speedruns**: check if they exist

## Conceptual Design

- **Achievements 1**: Brainstorm, include ideas from similar sets, manual, etc.
  - Note secrets, progress, key events, collectibles, scores
    benchmarks, Easter eggs, bosses, key items, par times, internal rewards.
- **Research 2**: Check/test that designs are possible.
- **Memory 1**: Estimate needed addresses for achievements.

## Memory hunt

- **Memory 2**: Search for needed memory addresses.

## Achievement Design

- **Balance 1**: Balance set for difficulty distribution, remove or redesign
  those that don't fit.
- **Achievements 2**: Build the list, push complete to unofficial (not required).
- **Memory 3**: Search for solutions missing, depending on the game's memory.
- **Achievements 3**: Add new ideas as they come.
- **Achievements 4**: Rework or remove ideas that are impossible.

## Pre-release Final steps

- **Titles & Descriptions**: Finalize
- **Bugs 1**: Test achievements for bugs, possibly make/use movies.
- **Game page**: Update. Game icon, images, info, resources, similar games.
- **Leaderboards** (optional): Code

- **Badges**: Create

## Release
