# DevQuests

## What are DevQuests?

DevQuests are achievement development-related quests that Developers can take part in at any time. Each one has a specific goal and upon reaching that goal, the achievement developer will earn the badge. DevQuests are not available for Junior Developers.

## General Rules

1. **Set-Creation Credit**: To be awarded credit for Set-Creation quests, contact the DevQuest Team via Discord ping in [`#devquest`](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/842845740078334002) or via [site message](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=DevQuest) within 1 week after publishing the set. Include a link to the game and which DevQuest it is being used for. (No need to do this for DevQuest 015 or 020 -- We handle those in sweeps separately). Note: Sets may still be disqualified for quality or rules reasons at this point. Contact us prior to release if you wish to confirm eligibility.
2. **Maintenance Quest Credit**: For maintenance achievements (i.e.: DevQuest 001, DevQuest 005, DevQuest 04, etc), just create a column in the DevQuest Remastered sheet to the left of completed entries and fill it in as you work. Contact the DevQuest team when you are complete with all entries for review. For Maintenance Quests that can be repeated, one row of the column will be for which badge number you are working towards.
3. **Revision Quest Credit**: For Revision achievements (i.e.: DevQuest 002 and DevQuest 013), make sure your choice is already on the corresponding approved list. You will need to satisfy the repair plan. These quests should be more than simple one-achievement revisions. If a repair plan seems to be overly simple, contact us first to ensure it will qualify. **When you start working on a revision quest, contact the DevQuest team** so the sheet can be updated; this lets other users know it is being worked on.
4. Unless otherwise stated in a DevQuest's description, collaborations are not allowed.
5. Standard set quality or better is expected for DevQuest sets. If a set appears to be of insufficient effort or a copy/paste set, it may be rejected at the DevQuest team's discretion. Rich Presence is required for DevQuest sets. The DevQuest team is happy to suggest improvements for qualification.
6. New sets may only be applied towards one Set Creation DevQuest. No double-dipping.
7. Always contact the active authors on sets whose content you will update or add to.

## Reporting

- Contact the team using the DevQuest team via [site message](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=DevQuest) or on in [`#devquest`](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/842845740078334002) on Discord.

## Schedule and Announcements

- DevQuests do not have a specific release schedule. Typically, they are announced shortly after their badge has been completed.
- New DevQuests and any updates to existing DevQuests will be announced in `#developer-news` on the RetroAchievements Discord and site news

## Suggestions

- If you have suggestions for a DevQuest, send a message to the DevQuest account with the following info:
  - **Quest Name**
  - **Award Type** - If there is one specific goal then you would want a badge-based award. If there are multiple goals then you would want an achievement-based award.
  - **Game Type** - State whether hacks, homebrews, prototypes, unlicensed, and/or subsets are allowed.
  - **Goal(s)** - A brief description of the DevQuest. Examples: "Develop a set for such-and-such console," "Develop a Holiday-Themed Set," "Create Dynamic Rich Presence for 10 Games," etc.
  - **Rules** - List any specific guidelines and criteria that submissions must meet. Is there a minimum achievement count? Are there minor exceptions that result in half-credit? Do submissions need to be pre-approved? The more simple they are, the better!
