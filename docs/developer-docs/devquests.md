# DevQuests

## What are DevQuests?

DevQuests are achievement development-related quests that developers can take part in at any time. Each one has a specific goal and upon reaching that goal, the achievement developer will earn a badge. 

## General Rules
Outside exceptions explicitely written in the individual quest rules, quests of each type follow the general rules below:
- DevQuests are not available for Junior Developers.
- To be awarded credit towards a quest, ping the team via a Discord ping in [`#devquest`](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/842845740078334002) or via [site message](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=DevQuest) within one week of completion, with a link to the appropriate achievement page.
- Collaborations and subsets are not allowed by default.
- If you are working on a set and it becomes eligible to a DevQuest, it cannot be used if 50% of the work is already done. This can happen when new quests are introduced, when a set receives enough requests to be eligible for [DQ7](#007-most-wanted) or when a set is featured in Wish This Set, making it eligible for [DQ16](#016-wish-this-set). If this happens while you are *less* than halfway done, please reach out to the team to confirm eligibility.

Type specific rules:

**Set-Creation**
- Making a set can only contribute to a single quest. For example, if you make a set for a Japan-exclusive game with a female protagonist that was featured on Wish This Set, you have to choose between [DQ8](#008-world-traveler), [DQ16](#016-wish-this-set) and [DQ24](#024-she-s-got-this), you don't get all three.
- Standard set quality or better is expected for DevQuest sets. If a set appears to be of insufficient effort, it may be rejected at the DevQuest team's discretion. Rich Presence is required for DevQuest sets. The DevQuest team is happy to suggest improvements for qualification.

**Maintenance**
- You cannot be an original author on the set being maintained.
- General revision rules apply: contact the active authors on sets whose content you will update or add to. Moreover, discussions, dev votes and revision claims are required when adding new achievements to a set.
- Every action can only contribute to a single quest. For example, if you repair a set for [DQ2](#002-retro-renovator), resolving tickets is part of that task, so these tickets cannot be tallied up towards [DQ1](#001-ticket-massacre).  However, some sets can benefit from different independant actions in a way that yields credits towards multiple DevQuests. If you add a rich presence, leaderboards and revise a set to cover content that was missing before, you could get credit for DQ13, DQ14 and DQ22.
- For revision quests ([DQ2](#002-retro-renovator), [DQ13](#013-complete-me) and [DQ22](#022-this-belonged-in-a-museum) Dust-offs), the game needs to be in the approved list. You may propose games you feel should qualify prior to working on them and the team will determine if it fits the quest. While [DQ13](#013-complete-me) credit can sometimes be granted along [DQ2](#_002-retro-renovator) or [DQ22](#022-this-belonged-in-a-museum), this is up to a team vote and should only be allowed when both the current content and missing content require significant work.
- When you update the logic of any asset, keep a backup of the old logic posted in the game's official forum for reference.
- For miscellaneous maintenance quests ([DQ1](#_001-ticket-massacre), [DQ3](#003-singles-in-your-area), [DQ5](#005-trigger-happy) and [DQ14](#014-laudable-leaderboards)), create a column in the DevQuest Remastered sheet to the left of completed entries and fill it in as you work. Contact the DevQuest team for review only after you have completed the quest. For quests that can be repeated, one row of the column will be for which badge number you are working towards.

**Legacy**

Legacy quests ([DQ4](#004-veteran-developer), [DQ15](#015-console-conqueror) and [DQ20](#020-genre-conqueror)) are fully retroactive and are awarded for having an extensive and wide portfolio as a developer.
- You may request to be tracked for these after reaching some minimum treshold as determined in the rules of each individual quests.
- Following that first tracking request, updates are made in sweeps periodically; this means you don't have to (and shouldn't) ping the team every time you complete a new set that adds to your portfolio. Every couple months, the dev responsible for the sweeps for that particular quest will update the status of everyone being tracked and announce the progress in [`#devquest`](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/842845740078334002).

   - Full Set Dust-Off = 4 Points
   - Miscellaneous Task = 1 Point
   - At least one set dust-off required for the badge.
2. Full Set Dust-Off: Clean up old code notes, update achievement logic for modern best practices (removing unnecessary Hits and Resets to use Delta checks instead, for example), update with cleaner badges, update descriptions and achievement titles, new dynamic RP.
3. Misc Tasks: Update a set in order to remove it from the following QA Hubs. Doesn't stack with a Full Set Clearing.
   - [No Dynamic RP](https://retroachievements.org/game/3083)

5. A snapshot of the spun user's most recently recorded request list will be made at the time of random selection. Game selections will be validated against this list only.
   - You can see this list on the `Quest23: Elligible Games Lists` sheet within the DevQuest Sheets document.
6. You may swap lists with other participants. All participants must confirm the swap before it is performed. Muti-way swaps (three or more developers) are allowed. Swapping will reset your three-month respin timer.

**Type**: Set Creation  
**Goal**: Publish two new sets featuring a female character as the primary protagonist!  
**Repeatable**: No

1. Sets intended for this quest must be complete and encompass all notable content specific to the game.
2. Hacks are allowed, but the original game must **not** have a female character as the primary protagonist.
   - Sets for small hacks will be scored as a half point.
3. Homebrew is allowed
   - Sets for small homebrew games will be scored as a half point.
   - Up to one point can be from homebrew.
4. Collaborations are allowed. A set done as a collaboration will be scored as a half point for any collaborator receiving credit towards this quest.
5. The primary protagonist must be clearly identified as a female character somewhere in the game.
   - Games without a clear singular protagonist are allowed as long as a clear majority of the protagonists, i.e.: About 2/3 of the protagonists driving the story, plot, or game action should be clearly identified as female characters.
   - Any characters falling into such protagonist roles should be player-controllable.
   - Games where the player creates an avatar do not count the avatar as a female protagonist unless the avatar is required to be female.
   - When in doubt, please reach out to the DevQuest team.
6. Each point of credit (equivalent to one set) must have a different female character as the protagonist (or different ensemble of female characters)

## Wheel Spin DevQuest Rules
[DQ6](#006-the-unwanted), [DQ19](#019-wheel-of-genres) and [DQ23](#023-well-of-wishes) use wheels to give random goals. You are allowed to spin again to change your random goal **three months** after spinning. The first and second spins for each quest are free. If you want to keep on spinning, you will need to earn a new respin token by doing one of the following tasks:
- Resolve (Not close) 10 tickets from inactive devs (can be used towards [DQ1](#001-ticket-massacre) Ticket Massacre)
- Earn [DQ3](#003-singles-in-your-area) Singles in Your Area
- Update 10 achievements towards [DQ5](#005-trigger-happy) Trigger Happy
- Earn a point towards [DQ2](#002-retro-renovator) Retro Renovator or [DQ13](#013-complete-me) complete.me
- Make a set for [DQ16](#016-wish-this-set) Wish This Set
  
Refreshing your spin this way can only be done while your spin is used up. For example, you cannot use an old Wish This Set game you made prior to spinning.

## New DevQuests and suggestions

- New quests will be available periodically. There is no fixed schedule for these.
- If you have suggestions for a DevQuest, send a message to the DevQuest account with the following info:
  - **Quest Name**
  - **Award Type** - If there is one specific goal then you would want a badge-based award. If there are multiple goals then you would want an achievement-based award.
  - **Game Type** - State whether hacks, homebrews, prototypes, unlicensed, and/or subsets are allowed.
  - **Goal(s)** - A brief description of the DevQuest. Examples: "Develop a set for such-and-such system," "Develop a Holiday-Themed Set," "Create Dynamic Rich Presence for 10 Games," etc.
  - **Rules** - List any specific guidelines and criteria that submissions must meet. Is there a minimum achievement count? Are there minor exceptions that result in half-credit? Do submissions need to be pre-approved? The more simple they are, the better!
