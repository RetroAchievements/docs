# RALibretro

!! This page is wildly out-of-date

RALibretro is a multi-emulator that can be used to develop RetroAchievements.

The "multi-emulation" feature is only possible because it uses [libretro](https://github.com/libretro/) cores to do the actual emulation. What RALibretro does is to connect the emulation to the tools used to create RetroAchievements.

## WARNING

**RALibretro is a Work-in-Progress!!!**

Currently the development is going on this repo: [https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro)

Here's a list of known issues (feel free to report new issues if you find one): [https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro/issues](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro/issues)

## Installation Instructions

Just download RALibretro from the [Downloads page](https://retroachievements.org/download.php) and unzip it.

## Basic Usage

1. Launch RALibretro.exe
2. Click on `File` > `Load System`, and click on the system you want to emulate

## How to make AES BIOS work in RALibretro or RetroArch

To make AES BIOS emulation mode work in your emulator:

1. Make sure your emulator works correctly.

2. Put `neogeo.zip` to `System` directory (RALibretro), or a folder you keep your NeoGeo ROMs (RetroArch).

3. Make sure the `neogeo.zip` consist of at least files you can see here:

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/68l37qbt8myts82/aesminimum.png)

If you keep only those files, AES mode will be automatically forced for any NeoGeo game (recommended).

**Important!** The files which are highlighted on this picture (`neo-epo.bin` and `neo-po.bin`) are the only one actually related to AES mode, and you probably will need to include them in your archive to make AES mode work for you. `neo-po.bin` is necessary for japanese-only titles or to make the japanese versions to work, but due to emulation issue it also forces japanese language as default, that's why you will need to remove it to display english in some games.

4. Load any FBA compatible neo geo ROM. More complete archive (including files needed to run MVS and UniBIOS modes) might need additional configuration to force AES mode:

In RaLibretro: Settings->Emulation->Force Neo Geo Mode->AES

In RetroArch: Command->Menu Toggle->Options->Force Neo Geo Mode->AES
