# DevQuests

## What are DevQuests?

They're achievement development-related quests that developers can take part in at any time. Each one has a specific goal and upon reaching that goal, the achievement developer will earn the badge.

## General Rules

1. For Set-Creation achievements other than DQ15, please announce your DQ pick in devquest or via the DevQuest inbox on site early on in your development. This will give us time to make sure any issues with the choice can be sorted out early. Late requests may not count.
2. For Maintenance achievements (i.e.: DQ1, DQ5, DQ14, etc), just create a column in the DevQuest Remastered sheet to the left of completed entries and fill it in as you work. Contact the DevQuest team when you are complete with all entries for review.
3. For Revision achievements (i.e.: DQ2 and DQ13), make sure your choice is already on the corresponding approved list. You will need to satisfy the repair plan. These quests should be more than simple one-achievement revisions. If a repair plan seems to be overly simple, contact us first to ensure it will qualify.
4. Unless otherwise stated in a DevQuest's description, collaborations are not allowed.
5. Standard set quality or better is expected for DevQuest sets. If a set appears to be of insufficient effort or a copy/paste set, it may be rejected at the DevQuest team's discretion. Rich Presence is required for DevQuest sets. The DevQuest team is happy to suggest improvements for qualification.
6. New sets may only be applied towards one DevQuest. No double-dipping.
7. Always contact the active authors on sets whose content you will update or add to.

## Reporting

- Contact the team using the DevQuest team on site or on in #devquest on Discord.

## Schedule and Announcements

- DevQuests do not have a specific release schedule. Typically, they are announced shortly after their badge has been completed.
- New DevQuests and any updates to existing DevQuests will be announced in `#developer-news` on the RetroAchievements Discord and site news

Must **put measured and/or triggered where it makes sense**. Do so on all appropriate achievements in the set. Achievements with unnecessary use will not be counted. If you hit 50 and there is more in a set to update, you must update the rest of the set.<br>2. You can do achievements in your **own sets** at half credit. Put both achievements on the same line, with a / between them. **Link** each achievement ID to the achievement's page.<br>3. You **must** _leave comments_ on set page for what you changed for log purposes<br>4. May not overlap with the required repair plan for DevQuest 2 or with any completion requirements for DQ13<br>5. **TEST all changes**. Ensure triggers appear when they should, and do not appear when they should not. Ensure the achievement can still trigger when expected.<br>6. **Subscribe to tickets** on the updated sets so you can catch any `Trigger` or `Measured` related tickets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If in doubt, ask when you ping to choose the game for the quest.<br>4. You may respin one time. Respins cannot occur until three months have passed since a wheel spin<br>5. Tasks are available to restore your respin. See the Wheel Respin Token Tasks for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Genres used for this quest are the main Genre hubs. We'll contact you to ask which genre is preferred.<br>5. If a set belongs to multiple top-level genres, we will ask you which genre to count for that set; if later on you do that same genre, you may ask us to reassign the set to the other genre.<br>6. Please fill out the Genre field in all sets for you wish to be credited and also assign it to the correct hub(s). Sets with unfilled Genre fields will be skipped.<br>7. Falsifying a genre or subgenre field will bar you from this DevQuest<br>8. Sole or Majority Dev will be credited.

Sets intended for this quest must be complete and encompass all notable content specific to the homebrew game.<br>2. Sets for homebrew systems (like WASM-4, Arduboy, and Uzebox) are worth half credit.<br>3. Collaborations are allowed. Credit will only be given to collaborators with 20 or more achievements in the set. At DQ Team suggestion, overly inflated sets may be disallowed.<br>4. Homebrew that is essentially the same as another you've done will not count (i.e. multiple Flappy Bird clones can only garner credit once)<br>5. One set per large homebrew collection maximum (i.e. One Net Yaroze 2014 Collection set allowed)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Suggestions

- If you have suggestions for a DevQuest, send a message to the DevQuest account with the following info:
  - **Quest Name**
  - **Award Type** - If there is one specific goal then you would want a badge-based award. If there are multiple goals then you would want an achievement-based award.
  - **Game Type** - State whether hacks, homebrews, prototypes, unlicensed, and/or subsets are allowed.
  - **Goal(s)** - A brief description of the DevQuest. Examples: "Develop a set for such-and-such console," "Develop a Holiday-Themed Set," "Create Dynamic Rich Presence for 10 Games," etc.
  - **Rules** - List any specific guidelines and criteria that submissions must meet. Is there a minimum achievement count? Are there minor exceptions that result in half-credit? Do submissions need to be pre-approved? The more simple they are, the better!
