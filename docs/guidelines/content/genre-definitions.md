## Role-Playing Game

- Games revolving the development of a character or party of characters and the growth of their stats or abilities
- Characters have defined levels and attributes (ex. strength, charisma, etc.) which affect the character’s gameplay (ex. damage against enemies or ability to persuade another character)
- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH:
	- Strategy: Both involve managing characters, but strategy involves managing several somewhat similar units, whereas RPGs involves managing a few unique characters

If the theme or premise of the game can easily be switched and the gameplay remains the same, it’s likely an action or arcade game. If you cannot change the theme without completely changing the gameplay, then it’s likely a simulation game.

## Strategy

- Games which challenge skills relating to planning, analysis, logistics, and/or tactical thinking
