# Hash Labels

Every ROM that is linked to an achievement set should be clearly identified and labeled. These labels help players know which versions of a game are compatible as well as if there are any translation patches, bug fixes, cosmetic hacks, quality of life hacks, etc. that they can use.

[[toc]]

## Info for Linked Hashes

- RA Hash: Check [Game Identification](/developer-docs/game-identification) to learn more about these. These appear in `Manage Hashes` automatically.
- Filename - Filename should be entered as the description. These are typically automatic, but may need some adjustments.
- Labels - You can use the labels listed below by using the filename of the image (no extension).

## Images

The following are used for preservation groups or collections:

## Examples

### Deja Vu (NES)

![managehashes-dejavu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45054151/233319646-3f288d54-8abc-42f1-8c50-34405e1fffae.PNG)

- The first hash is the USA version of the game with an Uncensored patch applied to it. The full text of the description is `Deja Vu (USA) (Uncensored) (v1.0) (usertheloset).nes`, which follows the [RAPatches naming scheme](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches#naming-scheme). The labels used are `nointro` and `rapatches`.
- The second hash is the No Intro-verified USA version of the game.
- The third hash is the No Intro-verified Japanese version of the game.

To see how this will look for the majority of users, go to the game entry page and click on "Linked Hashes."

![links-dejavu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45054151/233319538-9dc200b8-7b81-4d2f-8b92-0c7c4ebf0df6.PNG)

As you can see below, `nointro` became ![no-intro-label](https://retroachievements.org/Images/labels/nointro.png) and `rapatches` became ![rapatches-label](https://retroachievements.org/Images/labels/rapatches.png).

### Suikoden (PlayStation)

We'll skip the manage hashes example for this one. Let's go straight to "Linked Hashes" on the game entry page:

![links-suikoden](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45054151/233319575-edce08ec-b0d7-453f-8bc2-5156e5fdb259.PNG)

The hashes labeled with `redump`, `rhdn`, and `rapatches` require patches that are available on both romhacking.net and in the RAPatches repository.

![linkedhashes-suikoden](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45054151/233319441-ea33b79d-a64b-46d7-a7c3-94e10ad3fa3f.PNG)

## Linking to Patches

- The first post of a game's forum topic is the best place to include links to patches required.
- These do not need to follow a specific format, but the information must be clear.
- Here is one example of how to format the text in the forum:

Input Text:

```
[b]Suikoden (Europe) (De) (v1.01) (Twisted Phoenix Game Translation)[/b]
[b]Suikoden (Europe) + [url=https://www.romhacking.net/translations/5736/]German Patch[/url][/b] [img=Images/labels/rhdn.png]
or
[b]Suikoden (Europe) + [url=https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/raw/main/PS1/Translation/German/11255-Suikoden-GermanTranslation.7z]German Patch[/url][/b] [img=Images/labels/rapatches.png]
[i]RA Checksum: [/i]f0c5ec0696aa2ec2d6e5b731fbe07491
```

![forum-label-01-suikoden](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45054151/233319102-ed9f77c5-0e10-428f-9d05-57b1fb1c9b1b.PNG)

- A second example:
  Input Text:

```
[img=Images/labels/rapatches.png] [img=Images/labels/rhdn.png]
Download the patch from RHDN [url=https://www.romhacking.net/translations/5736/]here[/url].
RAPatches Mirror [url=https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/raw/main/PS1/Translation/German/11255-Suikoden-GermanTranslation.7z]here[/url].
```
