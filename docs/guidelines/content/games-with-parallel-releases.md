# Games with Parallel Releases

Some games have multiple versions that were released simultaneously in-parallel and are designed to interact with each other but offer differing play experiences while remaining at their core the same game. Ex: Mainline Pokemon games.

::: tip Retail Games Only
This policy only applies to retail games. Hacks with parallel releases shall not have separate sets unless there are significant differences, subject to approval by the Developer Compliance team.

## What Sets Can They Have?

- Each version shall have its own set.
- Each versionâ€™s set shall have a different author.
- Sets whose versions were merged into one core set before this policy entered effect may remain merged.

## Can We Un-Merge Existing Sets?

Unmerging shall be allowed if a game currently has a merged core set, under the following requirements:

- The author of the merged core set shall be given preference as to which version their work shall become.
- Version-specific achievements in the merged core set shall be transferred with authorship intact to the other version upon unmerge.
- The unmerge plan must be approved by the Developer Compliance team, with input from the QA-Maintainers team.
- A satisfactory plan for how to handle unlocks for players that have earned the merged set achievements must be developed and approved.
- Must pass a revision vote.
