# Games with Parallel Releases

Some games have multiple versions that were released simultaneously in-parallel and are designed to interact with each other but offer differing play experiences while remaining at their core the same game. Ex: Mainline Pokemon games.

::: tip Retail Games Only
This policy only applies to licensed retail games. Other categories of games, such as hacks, shall not have separate sets for parallel releases unless there are significant differences, subject to approval by the Developer Compliance team.

## What Sets Can They Have?

- Each version shall have its own set.
- Each versionâ€™s set shall have a different author.
- Sets whose versions were merged into one base set before this policy entered effect may remain merged.

## Can We Un-Merge Existing Sets?

Unmerging shall be allowed if a game currently has a merged base set, under the following requirements:

- The author(s) of the merged base set shall be given preference as to which version their work shall become.
   - If no longer able to be contacted, use best judgement when presenting the unmerge plan, paying attention to any written record that may indicate preference.
- Version-specific achievements in the merged base set shall be transferred with authorship intact to the other version upon unmerge.
- The unmerge plan must be approved by the Developer Compliance team, with input from the QA-Maintainers team.
- A satisfactory plan for how to handle unlocks for players that have earned the merged set achievements must be developed and approved.
- Must pass a standard revision vote.
