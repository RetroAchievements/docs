# Set and Achievement Contribution Credit

[[toc]]

## Purpose of Contribution Credit
There are many different aspects to creating achievements for RetroAchievements. An achievement set is comprised of a set's design, code, artwork, writing, and stability testing. In some cases, a set's author accomplishes all of these tasks, but often times, others make important contributions to a set that merits recognition and credit.

This document establishes the guidelines for when credit may be assigned to contributors for each creditable task. Developers may assign task credit to users in accordance with this document. 

Assigning credit to people who did not provide significant and verifiable contributions is considered abuse of the credit system.

When in doubt, contact the [QATeam](https://retroachievements.org/user/QATeam) account to seek clarification.

## How to Assign Credit
Credit is assigned to people via the management app. Set-wide task credit is assigned on the **Set Credit**s** tab by clicking on the **Add contribution** credit button. Individual achievement credit can be assigned in bulk by selecting desired achievements on the **Achievements** tab then clicking **Bulk add credit**.

## Set Credit
### Authorship
Authorship is automatically conferred when a developer is the author of at least one promoted achievement in a set. Authorship is automatically determined and cannot be altered by developers.

### Mastery Icon Credit
Master icon credit shall be assigned to the person who created the set's current mastery icon. When a mastery icon is replaced, assign credit to the new icon's creator and set the **Date Credited** as the day the icon is replaced. In cases where there are multiple contributors to a mastery icon, the person who is responsible for producing the icon's focal point shall be assigned credit. Minor changes such as altering brightness, adding a border, or other minor changes where significant previous icon artwork is retained is insufficient to be awarded mastery icon credit.

## Individual Achievement Credit
### Badge Artwork
Badge artwork credit shall be assigned to the person who created the current achievement badge. When an achievement badge is replaced, assign credit to the new badge's creator and set the **Date Credited** as the day the badge is replaced. In cases where there are multiple contributors to an achievement badge, the person who is responsible for producing the badge's focal point shall be assigned credit. Minor changes such as altering brightness, adding a border, or other minor changes where significant previous badge artwork is retained is insufficient to be awarded badge artwork credit.

### Design
Achievement design credit shall be assigned, at the set developer's discretion, to the person responsible for providing the achievement's concept. Often times, design concepts evolve either during the set design phase or during development, which may make determining credit difficult. The set developer is responsible for determining who shall be assigned achievement design credit.

### Logic
Achievement logic credit is automatically assigned when an achievement is uploaded. It may be reassigned to another developer if it is **fully recoded** during a revision or ticket resolution. Correcting relatively minor issues is insufficient to assign logic credit.

### Testing
Achievement testing credit shall be assigned per Play Tester team guidance when testing occurs by through the Play Tester team process. For testing by non-Play Tester team members, but in direct coordination with a developer, the set developer shall use the following guidelines to determine if testing credit is appropriate:
- Testing occurred prior to the achievement being first promoted
- Testing was thorough and exhaustive meaning proper function was validated through multiple unlock attempts including expected situations and edge cases
- Issues discovered were corrected by the developer prior to promotion

### Writing
Achievement writing shall be assigned per Writing Team guidance when writing updates occurs through the Writing Team process. For writing updates by non-Writing Team members, the set developer shall determine if writing credit is appropriate based upon the following guidelines:
- Complete description rewrites
- Description corrections that rectify significant grammatical errors
- Description updates that remove use of unnecessary parenthesis or brackets
- General title or description improvements deemed credit worthy by the set developer
