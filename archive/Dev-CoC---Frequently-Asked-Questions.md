## Unwelcome Concepts

#### Regarding Unfinished Sets

- Q: How does the policy about unfinished sets affect compilation games, such as [Intellivision Classic Games (PlayStation)](https://retroachievements.org/game/13908)?
- A: If at least one game in the compilation adheres to said policy, then there's no need to worry. A "proper" compilation set would take a long time to develop, so adding achievements for one or two games at a time seems like an expected workflow.
