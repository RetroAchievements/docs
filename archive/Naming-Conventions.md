## Naming Conventions

- **No Symbols**: Do not use accented/special characters like the `é` in Pokemon, as they currently break a few things (like feed). They are also not visible in search without the special character. Same for UTF-8 Universal Emoji codes. **Allowed exception**: [Rich Presence Scripts](Rich-Presence).
