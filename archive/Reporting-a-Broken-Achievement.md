# Reporting Broken Achievements

To report a broken achievement, go to the achievement's page. Directly under the players won statistic, you'll see a link reading "Report an issue for this achievement." Click that link to take you to the "Report Broken Achievement" form

## Report Broken Achievement Form

When reporting a broken achievement, please fill out all the fields to the best of your ability. The more information we have on the issue, the better our chances of figuring out what went wrong.

# Issue

Select either "Triggered at wrong time" or "Doesn't trigger." These are the only two valid reasons for submitting a ticket. If you have criticisms about an achievement, you can post those in the comments.
Please Note: If you're submitting a manual unlock request for a network error, there's no need to file a ticket at all. Message RAdmin or post your request in the #Manual-Unlocks channel of our discord, specify that it was a network error and no actual problem with the achievement and we will take care of it for you.

**Triggered at wrong time:**
Select this option if an achievement popped at a time when it shouldn't have.

**Doesn't trigger:**
Select this option if you completed the requirements listed in the description but the achievement didn't trigger.

# Emulator

Select the emulator used in this drop-down menu. If using RetroArch or RALibRetro please also include information about the core used while playing.
Checksum:
Select your game's checksum here.
"But I don know dis."
It's very simple. The checksum is like your game's signature. It's how the emulator determines what game and what version of the game you're using. When you have it, you should find it on this drop-down menu. This can be extremely important when looking into a problem so please always try to include this information.

**To find your Checksum in RetroArch:**
Go to the Quick Menu, and scroll down to "Information." Under Information, you should see a line reading "RetroAchievements Hash." That long list of numbers and letters you see is your Checksum.

**To find your Checksum in RALibRetro or other RA standalone emulators:**
Under the "RetroAchievements" menu, the very last item on the list is "Get ROM Checksum." Simply click that and it will spit it out at you clear as day.

# Description

This is the most important field of all. Tell us what happened in as much detail as you possibly can. The less information provided here, the more difficult it is for us to figure out what went wrong. Even details that might seem insignificant to you could be very significant to us. The more you can tell us, the better our chances of being able to figure out why it happened. In other words, "Dis no werk!" isn't much help to us in figuring out what the problem was.
