## Intro

Rollouts are events that are meant to mimic a console launch. Developers participating in rollouts devote their time to working on achievement sets with the intent of having several sets ready once the console is supported for all players.

## General Guidelines

It's worth noting that these are general guidelines that apply to all rollouts. Individual rollouts may require addtional guidelines.

- Each rollout needs a coordinator/manager to handle a variety of tasks to ensure the rollout goes smoothly.

  - Task of Coordinator(s)/Manager(s)
    - Gauging interest from achievement developers.
    - Keeping track of claims to ensure there's no overlap and to keep the claims manager(s) up-to-date.
    - Having close communication with participants to answer questions and to resolve any conflicts that may arise.
    - Reporting emulator/core bugs and other issues to tech-team.
    - Provide necessary information to the RANews team, if applicable.
    - Maintaining a schedule so developers know when they are to officially claim their picks in the forum, when playtesters can start testing sets, and when the console's support will officially launch.
    - Ensuring the console ID is validated on the website when support launches, or at least be in contact with the web team to do so.

- Developers are limited to leading one set at a time, but may collaborate on as many sets as they wish. Upon completion of a set, they are to notify QA to look over their set and sign them off, which allows them to move on to their next pick, if applicable.

- As per the Developer Code of Conduct, Developers must be free of unaddressed tickets in order to have their claims locked in. They must also have an open claim slot.

- Since the overall goal of a rollout is to provide sets to launch with a console's support, developers who go inactive or otherwise end up not working on the chosen sets will have their claim lapsed. In other words, claiming a set just to sit on it will not fly and will result in a lapse.

## Rollout Process

- When a previously unsupported console becomes viable to work on achievements, developers are to be asked individually if they would like to participate in a console's rollout. If they are interested, they are to pick one game as their priority pick, but may provide a list of additional games as backup.
- The overall list is then sorted to see if there are any overlapping picks. If a priority pick is exclusive to one developer, they can be locked in for that pick. If multiple developers share the same priority pick, they will be encouraged to collaborate.
