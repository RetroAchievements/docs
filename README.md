## About

These are my changes

RetroAchievements is a community-driven project dedicated to enhancing the experience of retro gaming by adding achievements to classic games. Since its inception in 2012, RetroAchievements has brought a new layer of challenge and excitement to vintage titles, allowing players to revisit their favorite games with fresh objectives and a competitive edge.

Our mission is to celebrate and preserve the legacy of retro gaming by integrating modern achievement systems into classic games. We strive to create a welcoming and enthusiastic community where players and developers alike can share their passion for retro gaming and contribute to the project's growth.

This repository holds all the files for the official RetroAchievements documentation. Anyone may propose a revision to this documentation at any time, and if the proposed revision is accepted, it will go live instantly.
